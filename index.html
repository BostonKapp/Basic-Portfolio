            <p>
                Let me tell you a little bit about myself, I was born in Lowell, Massachusetts in June 1994. I moved down to Auburndale, Florida in March 2005 and have been here ever since. I travel an hour and half every day to get to school so it is a little bit of a journey, but this coding program is going to be worth the pain and travel. Hopefully, after I graduated from the program I can move somewhere out West, preferably to either Oregon or Washington.

                Before I came to this program I tried my hand in a couple different things mainly working as a selector at Publix for several years. Then when I left Publix I was introduced to the pawn industry and pipefitting. And nevertheless I didn't see myself doing either of those jobs for too long.
